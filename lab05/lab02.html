        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
        <p>I am Maddy de Vera and I’m a double major in <strong>Newhouse</strong> for Television Radio and Film, and in the <strong>iSchool</strong> for Information Management and Technology. </p>
        <p>If I pursue the entertainment route, I want to become a talent manager or radio host, and if I follow through with the technology industry I want to do cybersecurity.</p>

        <p> Outside of work and school I love to hike, crochet, and read. My favorite book series is “A Good Girl’s Guide To Murder” and my favorite national park I’ve hiked at is Rocky Mountain. </p>
        <p>My favorite foods:
        <ul>
            <li>Mac and cheese</li>
