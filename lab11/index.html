        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
        <main>

            <p>I am Maddy de Vera and I’m a double major in <strong>Newhouse</strong> for Television Radio and Film, and in the <strong>iSchool</strong> for Information Management and Technology. </p>
            <p>If I pursue the entertainment route, I want to become a talent manager or radio host, and if I follow through with the technology industry I want to do cybersecurity.</p>
            <p>Throughout my college career I have been interning with the Marketing, Data, and Communications team at Syracuse University. For my job I create YouTube videos, social media content, and analyze the data that goes along with it.</p>
            <p> Outside of work and school I love to hike, crochet, and read. My favorite book series is “A Good Girl’s Guide To Murder” and my favorite national park I’ve hiked at is Rocky Mountain. </p>
            <p>My favorite foods:
            <ul>
                <li>Mac and cheese</li>
                <li>Dino chicken nuggets</li>
                <li>Penne Vodka</li>
            </ul>
