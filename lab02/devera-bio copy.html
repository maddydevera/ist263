<body>
    I am Maddy de Vera and I’m a double major in Newhouse for Television Radio and Film, and in the iSchool for Information Management and Technology. If I pursue the entertainment route, I want to become a talent manager or radio host, and if I follow through with the technology industry I want to do cybersecurity. 

Throughout my college career I have been interning with the Marketing, Data, and Communications team at Syracuse University. For my job I create YouTube videos, social media content, and analyze the data that goes along with it. 

Outside of work and school I love to hike, crochet, and read. My favorite book series is “A Good Girl’s Guide To Murder” and my favorite national park I’ve hiked at is Rocky Mountain.
